bun up the dance

I have to fetch coin prices from apis... say coingecho or coinmarketcap.
I have to fetch data from contract,
Parameters function. derive public key from private key passed in the params.
Respond stuff in json, even the code messages like 200, 300.
Two apis, taking multiple private keys in json, returning/saving the public keys in db.
